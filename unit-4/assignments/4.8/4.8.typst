#heading(level: 2, "1. Define a set and give an example of a finite set")

/ set : any collection of items (nouns) in which the collection has no duplicates and is unordered; could have no items, a finite amount of items, or an infinite amount of items

#heading(level: 3, "Reflection")

I remembered the properties of sets both from memory of the reading and by remembering the properties of sets in python, since I've used them in python before. I forgot to include that they could be empty, finite, and infinite, and I added that to my definition after checking #link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)")[wikipedia]

#heading(level: 2, "2. State the difference between a subset and a proper subset")

A proper subset cannot be equal to the set it's a subset to. However, a non-proper subset could still be a subset to a set even if the subset and the set are equal.

#heading(level: 3, "Reflection")

I couldn't immediately recall the difference between the difference within thirty seconds, so I went to my notes that I took while reading Chapter 2 of Brisk Walk. From those notes, I identified the differences.

#heading(level: 2, "3. What is a power set and how do we write it?")

Given a set of elements, the power set of that set is a set that contains sets that represent all combinations of the original set, including all the elements, all combinations of the elements, and none of the elements (empty set)

#heading(level: 3, "Example of Power Set")

Given set:
$display(
    F = {"Dad, Mom"}
)$

Power set of $F$ is:

$display(
    PP(F) = {{"Dad", "Mom"}, {"Dad"}, {"Mom"}, emptyset}
)$

#heading(level: 3, "Reflection")

I did remember what I wrote down for power set from memory, but I also double checked my notes for Brisk Walk just to make sure I wasn't forgetting anything. I made up the example based on the example in Brisk Walk that I remembered.

#heading(level: 2, "4. What is cardinality and give an example of cardinality of an empty set and an example finite set")

/ Cardinality: the size of a set, or the number of elements in a set

Since an empty set by definition has no elements, it's cardinality is 0 (0 elements)

For a finite set like this:

$display(
    F = {"Me, Dad, Mom"}
)$

The cardinality (surrounding the set with ||) is 3 because there are three elements in the set

$display(
    |F| = 3
)$

#heading(level: 3, "Reflection")

I remembered the definition for cardinality from memory of reading Cool Brisk. I double checked my notes just to make sure the notation was correct

I googled: "operations on cardinalities of sets" and got to this #link("https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/cardinality/")[page], where I learned about the inclusion-exclusion principle. It had a formula for three sets, so I plugged in my values and used algebra to find the intersection

    \
    |L sect D sect overline(A)| = 10 - 4

This one really stumped me. I had to ask #link("https://chat.openai.com/share/665ebe28-3d28-4467-a9ac-c6e212462a99")[ChatGPT], and although it got a different answer, I understood it's conceptual intention, which I explained above. I'm not confident I got the correct answers for these, so I would appreciate if you verified my answers, and if I got them wrong, provide the correct work.

#heading(level: 2, "2. Use set theory to answer:")

Question: Given the universal set U = {10,20, 30, 40, 50} and sets A={10, 20}, B = {20, 30}, and C={30, 40} find
$display(
    (A union B) sect overline(C)

Compared to the first question, this was much easier because we were given all of the elements of the three sets. I just broke the question down bit by bit and did it myself using what I learned about AND and OR from previous units.

#heading(level: 2, "3. Determine subsets:")

Given the sets P ={x|x is a prime number} and Q = {2,3,5} determine if P is a subset of Q or if Q is a subset of P and justify it.

P is #underline("not") a subset of Q. For
$display(
    P subset Q
)$ to be true, all elements in P must be found in Q. However, prime numbers above 5 such as 7 are not found in Q, therefore,

$display(
    P subset.not Q
)$

On the other hand, all elements of Q #underline("could") be found in P (since 2, 3, and 5 are all prime numbers and would be elements of P). Therefore,

$display(
    Q subset P
)$

#heading(level: 3, "Reflection")

I also did this one mostly by myself. I went back to my notes to double check the definition for subset
