Recursive geometric:

$display(
A(n)=A(n-1)*r
\
A(0)="some number"
\
r="multiplier"
)$

#heading(level: 3, "Problem 3: Provide the first 3 terms of the following sequences:")

$display(
a(0)=4", common difference of "-2\
a(1) = 2\
a(2) = 0\

)$
\ \
$display(
a(3)=3", common ratio of 2"\
a(0)=3/8\

I did Problem 3 using my own knowledge. For the first one, I just subtracted 2 from the 0th term each time. For the second one, I put the function in $f(x)=b m^x$ format: $3=b (2)^3$ and solved for b to get the first (or 0th?) term.

#heading(level: 3, "Problem 6: Identify if the following equations are arithmetic or geometric and is it recursive or explicit")
\
+ explicit arithmetic: $a(n)=2n+5$
+ recursive arithmetic: $a(n)=a(n-1)-3$, $a(0)=4$
+ explicit geometric: $a(n) = 3*2^n$
+ recursive geometric: $a(n) = a(n-1)*(-0.5)$, $a(0) = 4$
+ arithmetic: $1, 7, 14, 21, 28, ...$
+ geometric: $32, 16, 8, 4, 2, ...$

For 5 and 6, can't tell if it's recursive or explicit since there's no equation

I did problem 6 using my own knowledge and memory from calculus 2 and the lectures.

#heading(level: 3, "Problem 9: Why is factorial recursive?")

Factorial is recursive because to get the answer, you have to multiply your current number by the number 1 less than it, or $n(n-1)!$. To get $3!$, you must do $3*(3-1)!$, and then $3*2*(2-1)!$, and---like a recursive problem---you keep breaking down the problem into smaller, easier parts until you get to the smallest part, $0!$

I came up with this response on my own. However, I did use ChatGPT to ensure that what I was saying accurately describing the recursive nature of factorial. Link #link("https://chat.openai.com/share/c70e433c-919f-4322-89d1-d848209a9fec")[here]
